## Vision

In today's political climate, mudslinging and controversy seem to be the most effective ways to gain attention. This environment incentivizes politicians who are active on Twitter to write explosive tweets that are likely to get more retweets than moderate ones in order to expand their political presence and attract wide publicity. More retweets you get, more audience you can reach and create threads of discussions.

This project examines if this strategy of writing polarizing or negative tweets is indeed effective in gaining people’s attention by using retweets as the primary metric to gauge people’s attention.

Overall, the process of exploring this question was fairly smooth and straightforward! 

## Data
We managed to find relatively robust datasets online, giving us about **1.6M** political tweets by **341 Republicans** and **306 Democrats** along with other public figures who contribute to political discourse.  Using this data, we created two databases using Google Cloud SQL to store and query. 

**Tweets**: {tweet_id, user_id, timestamp, content, favorite_count, retweet_count}

**Accounts**:  {user_id, screen_name, timestamp, follower_count, following_count}

In order to analyze the tweets, we only wanted to keep the **text data**; therefore, we cleaned our databases by removing extraneous information such as URLS, emojis, and special characters.




Additionally, we used the Twitter API to stream **1300** recent tweets by two prominent politians: Donald Trump (**700** tweets) and Elizabeth Warren. (**600** tweets).

## Methodology

Intuitively, the reasoning behind our approach is that tweets that have more retweets are more polarizing and receive more attention from the public. So, we first used our data to calculate a **Retweet Index**: a measure of a tweet’s retweets relative to its author's average amount of retweets. By doing do, we normalize our data and account for differences in baseline popularity and follower counts between different users.

Second, we used **Natural Language ToolKit** (NLTK) and **Google Cloud Natural Language Models** in order to determine the sentiment of a particular tweet between 0.0 (more negative sentiment) and 1.0 (more positive sentiment). 

In addition to using the Natural Language Processing model above, we ran several statistical analyses to examine the relationship between the **retweet index** and the **sentiment** associated with each post. By applying pre-trained sentiment analyzers to Tweets, we were able to analyze and visualize the distribution of sentiment in relation to popularity and party.
