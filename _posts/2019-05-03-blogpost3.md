## Vision ##

###Motivation###
In today's political climate, mudslinging and controversy seem to be the most effective ways to gain attention. This environment incentivizes politicians who are active on Twitter to write explosive tweets that are likely to get more retweets than moderate ones in order to expand their political presence and attract wide publicity. More retweets you get, more audience you can reach and create threads of discussions.

We recognize that US politics have become increasingly polarizing these days, and one of the domains in which the polarity is displayed/furthered is through social media (Twitter, for example). We therefore thought it would be interesting to venture into the abyss and look into the political polarity in politicians’ tweets! The process of exploring this question was a fairly smooth one for us - we managed to get pretty nice twitter datasets online, which left us with 1.6M political tweets to analyze (with labeled positivity - negativity), and we also got Twitter’s permission to scrape tweets almost immediately, which we did to get recent tweets by Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, as we thought it would be interesting to draw the similarity between them. (Therefore, yes we did make measurable progress towards this idea!) With 1.6M tweets and 1300 tweets from Donald Trump (700) and Elizabeth Warren (600), it is definitely a good point for us to start off! (Also some sort of mentioning of how we got data of the number of retweets that each tweet has)
