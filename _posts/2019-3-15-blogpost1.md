## Introduction ##


Hello! 

This is the first blog post for Brown University's CS1951a Data Science Final Project.

The students in our project group are:
Jack Kates, Julia Windham, Leo Ryu, Nam Do, and Sandra Ha. 

## Vision ##

One of the greatest problems driving apart modern society is the bitter divide between political parties. Bipartisian dialogue gets drowned beneath the name-calling, insult-tossing, and tantrum-throwing antics of members on both sides of the political spectrum. 

Our goal for the final project is to use Twitter data in order to ascertain public sentiment about various political issues. By doing so, we hope to discover which political issues create the most volatile impact amongst the general population.

## Data ##
Our method of collecting data for this project is two fold. 

The first is using tweets from the publically available datasets found [here](https://data.world/bkey/politician-tweets). One dataset contains tweets made by various politicians, and the second dataset contains tweets containing political information.

The second is using the Twitter API to streams real time tweets that contain a specific keyword. For example, we can use the API to stream 1000 tweets containing the word "debt". By streaming tweets based on keywords, we hope to collect tweets that accurately represent current public sentiment. 

## Initial Analysis ##

We loaded the data into a MySQL database. Our tweet database contains 1.6 million tweets. 

About 40% of the tweets in the database have never been retweeted, but the distribution is very long-tailed. The most popular tweet was retweeted more than 3.3 million times!

The dataset contains tweets of 341 Republicans and 306 Democrats, along with other public figures who contribute to political discourse.

## Next Steps ##

To measure the polarity of tweets, we will use sentiment analysis and retweet count. Currently, we are setting up a system to run the tweets through an existing language model to classify their sentiment from negative to positive. Our first round of analysis will look at relationships like party vs. sentiment, sentiment vs. retweet count, and the most commonly used words tweeted by American political figures.

## ML Analysis ##
In order to analyze the data, we used a basic sentiment analyzer as a metric of both negativity and polarity and retweets as a metric of popularity and attention.

We began by analyzing the distribution of positivity across all the tweets collected. We wanted to understand how the pre-trained sentiment analyzer scored our data, and whether it was evenly distributed across the scoring scale of zero to one. As demonstrated in the bar chart, the tweets skew towards being more positive. This is important to note because in the scatter plot below, the same skew is present but is more difficult to isolate.

The tweets' retweet counts, as seems natural, are greatly distributed but skew towards smaller values. From this visualization, the skewing along each axis is apparent, but it is difficult to tell if there are any trends besides this. 

### Insights ###
We notice that there is a skew in both the number of retweets and the positivity of the tweets. This is useful, because now we can do more to change our way of presenting the data and hopefully ascertain a clearer vision of what our actual hypotheses are. As seen in the charts above, we note an exponential increase in frequency of tweets as positivity scores increase. Similarly, we see a high density of tweets with few retweets.
